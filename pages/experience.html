                                    dedicated to companies. Also, although in a minor way, I learned the implementation

                                    smart contract and its use so that it can be made usable within the developed web

                                    I also got to learn how to perform some documentation steps related to a project
                                    such as
                                    making sequence diagrams, using the UML, and writing a description for certain parts
                                    of
                                    the project.

                                    In addition to programming languages I got to improve personal skills such as those
                                    related to team-working and smart-working, as well as character skills such as
                                    concentration, compliance, seriousness in work projects and more generally a
