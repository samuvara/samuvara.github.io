                                workplaces such as
                                construction sites or large warehouses.

                            <p>Description</p>
                            <p>Within the internship I had the opportunity to interface and to contributate with the
                                development of user interfaces and web apps on the Front-End side, going to build all
                                the part of the user registration forms and differentiating by basic user and business
                                user; I also developed the post login user interfaces differentiating them mainly in two
                                parts: a first one that corresponds to the basic user side and is the customer
                                interface, a second one that corresponds to the business side and is the interface
                                dedicated to companies. Also, although in a minor way, I learned the implementation of a
                                smart contract and its use so that it can be made usable within the developed web app.

                                I also got to learn how to perform some documentation steps related to a project such as
                                making sequence diagrams, using the UML, and writing a description for certain parts of
                                the project.

                                In addition to programming languages I got to improve personal skills such as those
                                related to team-working and smart-working, as well as character skills such as
                                concentration, compliance, seriousness in work projects and more generally a personal
                                growth and my level of English, written and oral.
                                Skills: Front-end Development · Web Design · Team Working· CSS · HTML · Sequence diagram
                                · Uml · Web Development · Typescript · Solidity · Ionic · React.js · JavaScript</p>
